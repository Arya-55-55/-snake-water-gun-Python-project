🚀 Just finished building a fun mini project in Python: Snake, Water, Gun Game! 🐍💧🔫

This simple terminal-based game helped me practice:
- Conditional logic
- Random module usage
- Loop control and user interaction
- Basic game mechanics

You can see explaination in (# comment part) infront of code 

It’s beginner-friendly and a great way to get hands-on with Python fundamentals. 🧠💻

I would love your feedback or suggestions for improvement!
